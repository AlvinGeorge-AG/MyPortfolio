## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlvinGeorge-AG/MyPortfolio.git
    cd MyPortfolio
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

To view the portfolio, run the development server.


## Running Locally

To start the development server and view the portfolio locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will typically start a local development server, and you can access the portfolio in your browser at a given address (usually `http://localhost:xxxx`).

## Build/Deploy

The `package.json` file contains build scripts that can be used for deployment.

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

This command will generate optimized static assets in a `dist` folder, which can then be deployed to any static hosting provider. Based on the repository's homepage (`https://alvingeorge-myportfolio.vercel.app/`), Vercel is a likely deployment platform.
